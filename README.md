Rules:
1. You can roll the dice until you get a one or decide to hold the score.
2. If you hold the score, your current score will be added to your total score and the second player can continue rolling the dice.
3. The first person to reach 100 points wins.
4. If you get 1, your current score becomes 0 and the other player gets to roll the dice.
5. If you get 3 simultaneous six, your total score will be reduced to 0 and the other player gets to roll the dice.

Have fun.
